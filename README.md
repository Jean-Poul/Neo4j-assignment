## About This Project

Objective
The Danish sports technology is experiencing significant growth, and the Danish Sports 
Confederation (DIF) expects big export success in the near future (see 
https://nyheder.tv2.dk/business/2022-04-16-dansk-branche-i-taarnhoej-vaekst ).
This assignment provides you with experience in implementing graph database technologies 
for storing data and retrieving information with a potential benefit for sports.
Tasks
In this Github repository (https://github.com/metrica-sports/sample-data) you will find 
materials related to measuring individual players’ performance in a team sport – in this case, 
football.
- There are sample data sets collected from three games of football - choose one of 
them.
- Build a graph model that represents best the event data of the game and enables
efficient searches in it.
- Create graph database and store the data in it.
- Apply Cypher queries, graph algorithms, libraries, and procedures for data analysis
that would support answering questions, such as 
o who is the most active player (in terms of passing and receiving the ball)?
o who has had a central role in the match?
o which players have attempted to score?
o which team has kept the ball longer?
o is there any close ‘societies’ between players (passing the ball to each other)?
o how close is the connection between two specific players?
o …
- Use graph visualization as much as appropriate


Submit the solution in your Github repository and a link to it in Peergrade.  

This is a group project, the solution of which provides 20 study points.

## Walkthrough 

All our answers to the above given questions are answered in the notebook Assigntment4-Neo4j-Nodesolution. For example with a query string (cypher) look in the notebook Neo4J-assignment-4-examplewithcypher.ipynb.
